8757,Why We Love Seeing Other People Fail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5pe4l3OFQw,Science&Technology,"Schadenfreude is enjoyment that’s derived from another person’s misfortune. It’s a complicated emotional response which feels good, but how much should it govern our decision making?

Stereotypes and Schadenfreude: Affective and physiological markers of pleasure at outgroup misfortunes
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887033/
“People often fail to empathize with outgroup members, and sometimes even experience Schadenfreude—pleasure—in response to their misfortunes. One potent predictor of Schadenfreude is envy. According to the Stereotype Content Model, envy is elicited by groups whose stereotypes comprise status and competitiveness.”

When your gain is my pain and your pain is my gain: neural correlates of envy and schadenfreude.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19213918
“We are usually motivated to maintain a positive self-concept, and we feel discomfort when our self-concept is threatened by others who outperform ourselves in a self-relevant domain. Considering the role of dACC in conflict monitoring, the association between envy and dACC activation suggests that envy is a condition in which information recognized by social comparison conflicts with positive self-concept. Experiencing discomfort motivates us to reduce it.”


Comprehending envy.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17201570
“The authors reviewed the psychological research on envy. The authors examined definitional challenges associated with studying envy, such as the important distinction between envy proper (which contains hostile feelings) and benign envy (which is free of hostile feelings). The authors concluded that envy is reasonably defined as an unpleasant, often painful emotion characterized by feelings of inferiority, hostility, and resentment caused by an awareness of a desired attribute enjoyed by another person or group of persons.”

4541,Chinese Type 56 AK-47 (Shooting and History),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6cqYLdIqmI,History,"Sold for $132,500.

One of the most common types of AK rifle in existence today is the Chinese Type 56 in its several variations, although very few of those rifles are in the United States in authentic full-auto form. This particular one was captured by a US soldier in the Vietnam War, who brought it back and registered it, making it a fully transferrable gun.

The Chinese received the technical package for the AK (and also the SKS, among other weapons) from the Soviet Union in the 1950s, as part of the USSR's policy of providing military and technical aid to other nations sympathetic to the Communist cause (although a rift would grow between the USSR and China later). China would manufacture tens of millions of AK rifles, both of this milled receiver type (the Type 3 style) and the later stamped AKM pattern. The standard fixed-stock rifles like this one were fitted with under-folding spike bayonets. Folding stocked types were also made, both underfolding (Type 56-1) and side folding (Type 56-2). These weapons have become extremely prolific, and can be found in virtually any significant international conflict zone to this day.

►Subscribe to my channel for more videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

After traveling through India, we took a flight from Delhi to Kathmandu. I was excited to explore a bit of Nepal, and we first began our explorations in the largest city of Kathmandu. Kathmandu is a beautiful city and there are quite a few things to do. But as a foodie traveler, I was of course most interested in sampling Nepali food and also Nepali street food, which I knew very little about before visiting Nepal.

In Kathmandu, there's not a lot of street food when you compare the city to a place like Bangkok. There are some stalls, but many of the street food is housed in small tiny little restaurants where you pull back a curtain and sit on small tables and benches to enjoy home cooked noodles and momo dumplings. Around the Boudha stupa (also known as Boudhanath stupa) in Kathmandu, there are some good Nepali street food carts, many of them serving a mixture of both Tibetan and Nepali street food snacks.

When I saw this cart that was cooking something extremely delicious smelling along with a pair of very friendly vendors, I knew I'd have to give it a sample. The vendors were very happy to be featured and I quickly ordered two items from their menu. All their street food were stacked within the glass encased cart and as soon as someone would order something, they would quickly dunk it into the hot oil until hot through and through. The vendors would then put them on top of a piece of newspaper, and slice them into pieces. Depending on your personal preference, the vendor would then scoop on a spoon of hot sauce to add extra flavor and complete the Nepali street food snack.

I started by street food sampling with a buffalo shapale, which is a Tibetan Nepali meat pie. It was filled with minced buffalo and possibly some onions. The flavor was great from the meat and it was improved by the hot and salty chili sauce. Next up was something known as an aloo chop, which is basically a deep fried potato cutlet. It was incredibly good, a ball of spicy mashed potatoes that were crispy on the outside and flavored so wonderfully. For my final Nepali street food snack this round, I couldn't resist a small piece of Nepal style fried chicken. The meat on the little drumstick was pushed all the way to the end so it provided a chicken handle with which is hold while enjoying the chicken. The chicken was pretty delicious, a proper street food snack. Thanks for watching this Nepali street food video and hope you can enjoy these snacks when you visit Kathmandu!

From the prairies of Saskatchewan to a Manhattan skyscraper we'll see the 21st Century's cutting-edge ""green"" technologies in action. New technologies such as carbon sequestration and bioremediation take on our most daunting environmental crises, from global warming and deforestation to nuclear waste and resource scarcity. See how blue-green algae are converted into automotive biofuel and methane from decomposing garbage is turned into clean-burning natural gas. Finally, we'll see how trees and other natural environments can be used as engineering materials to control flooding and rejuvenate dying rivers."

The Sound Of Cooperation: Musical Influences On Cooperative Behavior

""Music as an environmental aspect of professional workplaces has been closely studied with respect to consumer behavior while sparse attention has been given to its relevance for employee behavior. In this article, we focus on the influence of music upon cooperative behavior within decision-making groups. Based on results from two extended 20-round public goods experiments, we find that happy music significantly and positively influences cooperative behavior.""

""You're lying on your back in bed with a pair of headphones on, listening to a new album by one of your favorite artists. While you listen, you feel unexplained emotions brimming; it's as if you're transcending reality. The brain's ability to absorb and make sense of music - what some scientists refer to as organized sound - is highly complex and far more effective than even a computer's capacity to identify and process it. But questions about how exactly the brain takes in organized sound still remain: Why does it make us feel the way we do?""

It's hard to believe, but there was a time before every person in America carried devices that were capable of recording every second of every minute of every day. In fact, instead of just hitting record on a smartphone, people actually had to write stuff down to remember it! It was truly a dark time. As a result, many legends have formed about America in the absence of — oh, what do you call it — proof. Here, now, are 10 facts from American history that aren't actually true at all...

4164,The Market Revolution: Crash Course US History #12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNftCCwAol0,History,"In which John Green teaches you about the Market Revolution. In the first half of the 19th century, the way people lived and worked in the United States changed drastically. At play was the classic (if anything in a 30 year old nation can be called classic) American struggle between the Jeffersonian ideal of individuals sustaining themselves on small farms vs. the Hamiltonian vision of an economy based on manufacturing and trade. I'll give you one guess who won. Too late! It was Hamilton, which is why if you live in the United States, you probably live in a city, and are unlikely to be a farmer. Please resist the urge to comment about this if you live in the country and/or are a farmer. Your anecdotal experience doesn't change the fact that most people live in cities. In the early 19th century, new technologies in transportation and communication helped remake the economic system of the country. Railroads and telegraphs changed the way people moved goods and information around. The long and short of it is, the Market Revolution meant that people now went somewhere to work rather than working at home. Often, that somewhere was a factory where they worked for an hourly wage rather than getting paid for the volume of goods they manufactured. This shift in the way people work has repercussions in our daily lives right down to today. Watch as John teaches you  how the Market Revolution sowed the seeds of change in the way Americans thought about the roles of women, slavery, and labor rights.

Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. As America invested in its market economy, certain transcendentalists resisted the rise of production and consumerism over individual freedoms, including Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/excerpt-from-walden

992,One of the best restaurants in Chiang Rai - Lab Sanam Keela (ร้านลาบสนามกีฬา),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtTo_wzvqPY,Food,"I think one of the best restaurants in Chiang Rai is Lab Sanam Keela (ร้านลาบสนามกีฬา). You can read all the details about it here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/10/chiang-rai-restaurant-lab-sanam-keela/

I really love Chiang Rai as a city - it’s peaceful, usually has fresh air, the lifestyle is calm, relaxing and friendly, and most of all, there’s a good selection of food to eat. Ranging from northern Thai food to delicious Thai Chinese food, you’ll find plenty to devour when you’re in Chiang Rai. One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the city is Lab Sanam Keela (ร้านลาบสนามกีฬา), a restaurant located on the peaceful side of the city, near the Chiang Rai stadium and a school.

Lab Sanam Keela (ร้านลาบสนามกีฬา) serves mostly a menu of northern Thai dishes, and they have a bunch of specials on their menu as well. I didn’t see an English menu, but the menu did have pictures to make it easier for you to order if you don’t speak Thai. The restaurant is sort of like an oversized open air shack, one of the types of restaurants that looked like it started off small and just kept growing and expanding in size little by little, until turning into the pretty large restaurant that it is today. But it’s exactly my style of a restaurants - no frills, open air, makeshift tables, and just amazing food.

Ying and I first started off with a Thai dish known as Yang Ruam (ย่างรวม), which was basically just a mixed grill plate. It included grilled pork, and some grilled pork organs like intestines and liver. The meat was grilled until almost halfway to a jerky style meat - so it had a bit of chewy texture, and it was slightly dried out - which is the way it was supposed to be. Dipped into the house-made chili sauce, it was pretty tasty. I especially liked the intestines, which were like little nuggets of sausage. The next dish we ordered was Jeen Neung (จิ้นนึ่ง), a plate of beef steamed with lemongrass and galangal, and served on a plate with fresh sprigs of cilantro and a side dipping sauce of galangal chilli sauce, known in Thai as nam prik kha (น้ำพริกข่า). The combination was masterful, the meat was slightly chewy, but along with the galangal chilli sauce and the fresh herbs, it was sensational. It honestly almost tasted like a Sunday roast, only with more flavor from the chili and herbs. The Jeen Neung (จิ้นนึ่ง) was one of the highlights of my meal at Lab Sanam Keela (ร้านลาบสนามกีฬา) restaurant.

For another impressive dish we ordered the pla tabtim tod kratiem (ปลาทับทิมทอดกระเทียม), a fish deep fried, and topped with the most amazing pile of fried garlic that I’ve ever seen in my life. It was almost comical how much garlic they loaded on top of it. I did notice that the garlic was slightly battered before it was deep fried, so that did increase the size a bit, but nevertheless, it was a jaw-dropping mound of garlic. The fish was fried to an absolute crisp, and the sauce served was spicy and garlicky. The combination of the crunchy fried fish with the garlic and chili sauce was incredibly delicious. Our final dish, which we ordered just to wrap everything up and call it a complete northern Thai meal, was tom sab moo (ต้มแซ่บหมู), a soup of pork and herbs. It was a little on the greasy side, but wow was it extremely tasty. It was almost perfectly flavored, with chilies, lime juice, tomatoes, and cilantro, and the pork was so tender and so flavorful.

Lab Sanam Keela (ร้านลาบสนามกีฬา) is a wonderful place to eat in Chiang Rai, and I think it’s one of my personal favorite restaurants in the city. The open air, and relaxing atmosphere could not get much better, and the food is wonderful - spicy, sour, pungent, and ultimately delicious. If you visit Chiang Rai, Thailand, and looking for a delicious meal experience that’s heavy on the meat, you should check this place out.

1211,Thailand Vegetarian Food Festival (Part 2) - Bangkok 2012 เทศกาลกินเจ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKedwRUFm70,Food,"Head over to http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ for lots more delicious Thai food! And if you love to eat, check out the Eating Thai Food Guide here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/

The Thailand Vegetarian Festival (เทศกาลกินเจ) is a celebration that takes place annually in Thailand. It was in the 1800's that a group of Chinese opera singers were on tour in Thailand and traveling around. They landed in Phuket where they performed and eventually became ill. After some thought and discussion they decided they had not been showing respect and honoring the Nine Emperor Gods in the Daoist Chinese beliefs. To get better from their sickness, they made up their minds to go for a cleansing diet by remaining pure and eating a diet of only vegetarian food for the first nine days of the ninth lunar month. Along with the food, they also performed a number of rituals and ceremonies.

The vegetarian festival has since become a yearly event celebrated across the entire country of Thailand (เทศกาลกินเจ). The event attracts not only local Thais, but also a huge number of foreigners that come to experience wonderful vegetarian and vegan Thai food in abundance. The biggest of festivities takes place in southern Thailand, and especially in Phuket where there's a large population of Chinese. In the south of Thailand, the festival includes religious rituals, some ceremonies and also the famous self flagellation events, which are fascinating to witness. Participants in these sorts of activities believe that they are possessed by spirits and when they are cutting and slicing themselves, they don't believe they are actually hurting themselves but rather the spirits.

In Bangkok, the festival is less about self mutilation, but still includes plenty of ceremonies and plenty of vegetarian Thai food sprawled through the entire city. If you're in Bangkok, Yaowarat Chinatown is the home of the most significant celebration. Everyday during the festival, the streets are lined with yellow flagged vendors that serve snacks and meals that are purely vegetarian. In this Part 2 of the Thailand vegetarian festival I first enjoy a deep fried snack known as ewkuay (อิ่วก้วย) and then wash it all down with some nam lawhungkuay (น้ำหล่อฮั้งก้วย), a healthy herbal beverage. Then I head over to the Fan Jao Jo Surkong Chinese Temple in Bangkok (ศาลเจ้าโจวซือก๋ง) to see the ceremonies. Finally to wrap things up at the Thailand vegetarian festival 2012, I eat some tasty fruit salad!

It was around 01 o clock at the midnight and I spotted this guy in front of me when I reached somewhere near Kottakkal (I am not sure about the place). It took almost 10 minutes for me to overtake him. He was cruising at an average speed of more than 80 Kmph and found him struggling to overtake the lorries and other vehicles on this busy National Highway.

And then after a long struggle I finally overtook him and there I got another surprise to see. It was Bangalore Ernakulam Super Deluxe Airbus.

I visited this local market near the outskirts of Chengdu, Sichuan, China, and found Chinese street food and the atmosphere to be mind blowing and exciting! It was truly an experience visiting this Chinese street market! So much food and Sichuan ingredients, so many flavours to try!

Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

I visited this morning market on a Sunday morning in Chengdu at 8am with an empty stomach and money to blow with the goal of tasting foods and chatting with as many locals as possible. This is a true China experience. It was so busy, with so many people, so many things to buy and look at, tons of vegetables, meat, live chickens, live hens, live roosters, everything you could want really. Fresh handmade noodles, fresh Sichuan cold ""liangbancai"", and a huge meat market deli area with hanging pork and beef to choose from. All of the locals were friendly and talkative, although a bit surprised to see a foreigner walking through the area!

If you're visiting China as a tourist, you'll definitely want to take a walk through a busy morning market like this. There are countless street foods to try and people to chat to (If you speak a little mandarin). This market was mind blowing!

Rather than trying hot pot in Chengdu or hot pot in Chongqing, you could try some way cooler food in Chengdu at  local market like this. This should be a top priority in my opinion!

Chinese cuisine is so diverse, and I consider myself lucky to be able to live in Sichuan, eating Sichuan food everyday, tasting all the top Chinese foods to try whenever I want. I've decided to stay living in China for at least another 2 or 3 years to get the feel of it and eat as much as I can!

About TEDx:

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)"

This video was filmed as part of the Art of Teaching Project developed by MusicTeachers.co.uk and the Musicians' Union to show inspiring, professional teachers giving insights into the way they work."
7601,Shay Locomotive - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgX3JtwboEc,Science&Technology,"The Shay Geared Steam Locomotive, one of one hundred and sixteen known to remain worldwide (another five questionable and another six Willamette style Shays), was originally conceived by the American lumber merchant Ephraim Shay. The patent was sold to Lima Machine Works (eventually Locomotive Works Inc.) of Lima, Ohio who refined the concept and produced 2,768 Shays over a period of 67 years (1878-1945). The museum's Shay is composed of parts from two locomotives, one constructed in 1923, and the other in 1925. Both were constructed for the Merrill & Ring Lumber Co., Ltd and used in forestry operations at Theodosia Arm, British Columbia. The Shay was branded as the ""strong man of the woods"" because of its distinctive and unique mechanical workings, making it highly efficient in the logging industry. Immediately noticeable is the Shay's offset boiler to the left, positioned there in order to make room for the three cylinder engine mounted vertically on the right. The engine's pistons turn the crank shaft which is connected on both ends by universal and slip joints to the line shafts on the front and rear trucks. These transmit power to both axles on each truck by way of bevel gearing. Thus, all wheels are driven and produce tractive  or pulling  force of 22,580 pounds (10, 242 Kg), allowing the Shay to move along the steep grades of British Columbia's mountainous terrain while hauling substantial loads. With its flexible (pivoting and rotating) trucks, extra wide tires on each wheel and all axles powered design, the Shay Geared Steam Locomotive was able to negotiate the unrefined forestry railways that would easily stop or derail a conventional rod locomotive."

1204,Malaysian Economy Rice - Street Chinese Food,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qPqUfYlldA,Food,"Be sure to click on my website here http://migrationology.com/ for lots more travel and street food photos and videos! Malaysian street food is one of the best cuisines in the entire world. Part of the reason it's so good is because there's such an incredible variety of food to eat. Local Malay, Indian, and even authentic Chinese food are all very much a part of the local dining scene in Kuala Lumpur and throughout the entire country of Malaysia. One of the cheapest meals to eat in Kuala Lumpur is known as economy rice. The term normally refers to Chinese food that served like a buffet style right off the streets. Everyday, there are loads of economy rice eateries that sprout up around the city to provide workers with tasty filling meals that don't break the bank. Throughout the day you'll find economy rice stalls, but my particular favorite time to eat at them is for lunch. On this particular day, I was just walking around looking for something good to eat when I noticed a cluster of outdoor carts and few people hovering around all the food. After seeing what the commotion was about, there was not way for me to resist having Malaysian Chinese food lunch. It works pretty simple, the vendor just hands you a plate of steamed rice, and you proceed to pile on as much or as little side dishes as you want. after filling your plate to your heart's desire, you go back to the vendor who simply calculates how much food or meat you took and write you a bill for how much you owe. I got a few vegetables, some tofu and nice helping of pork ribs and my bill came to just 4.5 Ringgits which is about $1.50. The tofu was nice stewed in a sweet soy sauce blend giving it plenty of flavor - I'm also guessing it was fried beforehand to give it a nice crunchy exterior and soft interior. The vegetables, were some kind of a green leaf spinach vegetable that were nice stir fried with chunks of garlic. But the real dish that I was most excited to try were the thumb sized chunks of pork spareribs that were cooked in a light black bean sauce. They were fall apart tender and wildly delicious! Though economy rice is an everyday working class Chinese street food meal in Kuala Lumpur, I'd have to say that it's well worth the price tag and the food is pretty tasty!

Arguably the coolest and most unique part of The European Union Program is the immense amount of traveling you get to do with this amazing group of people allowing you to learn so much in the places you're studying while also getting so close to new friends.

Last week we visited the homes of several European Union institutions, reinforcing all we've been learning in our EU Integrative Seminars back in Freiburg. In Luxembourg we visited the Court of Justice and European Investment Bank. Brussels houses most of the institutions including, the Commission, Council, and more. We had several class-specific meetings in Brussels as well. Paris was more of a bonus because in addition to visiting the European office for the International Monetary Fund, we had about a day and a half of free time.

At IES Abroad, we know study abroad. Every day we see how studying abroad changes students' lives. As a not-for-profit organization that puts purpose before profit, we're proud of our legacy and leadership in the study abroad field.

11 Most Ridiculous Purchases by Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather!
https://youtu.be/gjskIvCrG2Y

Here are the most amazing facts you probably didn’t know about ancient egypt!
9 – Equality has been around, I told you!
Seems like the society of ancient Egypt was well ahead of its time on this issue, because men and women were equal under the law! That meant women were free to live without a legal male guardian and could make their own decisions.
There were however, certain limits in occupations.  For example, a woman wouldn’t be allowed to hold a position in the army nor would a man be expected to be in charge of a household. However, everything else was equal. For example, women could marry whomever they wanted and later on divorce if things didn’t work out. Women could also buy and manage their own property, meaning a woman could inherit things down the female line in her family. Another fun fact was that neither six was favored when it came to childbearing, as both sixes were seen as equal.
The Ancient Egyptian gods and goddess are another proof of how far the equality went, as each six was determined to be as important as the other, and that each six had a unique set of skills.  Hey, that makes total sense to me, I KNEW men and women are different!  Also, you might be surprised to learn that both sixes wore make-up, something that was more of a social norm rather than gender right.
8 – Who really built the pyramids?
The pyramids are as grand and mesmerizing as they can be. Majestic establishments of up to 455 feet built in order to offer shelter for the part of the dad king’s soul that stayed behind. Let’s just keep in mind the different technology available at the time, so it’s just utterly amazing how these structures were built.  Having structures as grand as pyramids proves just how advanced of a civilization existed on earth back in those times.
If you try and think about the construction process, you probably get instant flashes of that Cleopatra movie where sloves are laboring their lives away while a supervisor slashes his whip on their backs. As it turns out, that is an extremely common misconception, and the one responsible for conjuring the myth is the Greek historian Herodotus, all the way back in the fifth century BC. While it is true that there were sloves in ancient Egyptian society, they were mostly used for domestic labors or for field work, tasks fairly easier compared to the tiring construction of the pyramids.
Actual construction workers who were rather skilled were used for the pyramids – it was considered a huge honor to work on the pyramids and workers took pride in their work. Most of them were paid workers who took two or three-month shifts at the construction site and used to sleep and eat near the building area. In fact, they were entitled to so many rights, that they actually could do labor strikes if they didn’t get paid on time. One method of payment included beer, meaning that a day of work was worth almost a gallon and a half of beer! Hey, I think I know a few people nowadays who’d still sign up for this agreement!
7 – Hair?!  Get outta here!!
In many paintings and hieroglyphs dating back from Ancient Egypt, Egyptians are depicted with thick black shoulder-length hair, very often garnished with some golden details. However, don’t get it twisted, because it turns out that they actually despised hair!
In fact, they hated hair so much that they removed every single hair on their bodyes except for their eyebrows. Fun fact, they even removed their eyebrows in times of great grief, such as the occasion of a beloved pet cat dying! Ancient Egyptians, especially those in the upper layers, shaved off their heads and wore wigs instead. A pharaoh didn’t allow for anyone to see him without his what are called ‘nemes’ on, a headpiece that covered his hair. Some data suggests that Egyptians shaved off their hair and opted for wigs instead in order to protect their head from the blazing sun."

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best!

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless.

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:

1086,Kategna Restaurant - Ethiopian food you shouldn't miss in Addis Ababa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrrzSKo7xwE,Food,"Kategna restaurant was one of the best restaurants I ate at while I was in Addis Ababa. The menu is extremely extensive, and the food is amazing! More info: http://migrationology.com/2014/01/kategna-restaurant-addis-ababa-ethiopia/

One of the highlights of visiting Ethiopia, is eating Ethiopian food, and when you're in Addis Ababa there are many amazing restaurants to choose from. Kategna Restaurant is a well known favorite for locals that live in Addis Ababa, straight up because it's a nice environment, and most importantly, the food is outstanding. During the course of my stay in Addis Ababa, I went to Kategna restaurant a number of times, unable to resist the delicious flavors and nice atmosphere of the restaurant.

I began with a giant platter of Yetsom Beyaynetu, a mix of vegetarianan fasting dishes. The mix came out, beautifully arranged on a giant platter, filled with the wonderful assortment of different curries and stews. There was misir wat, a red lentil stew, some different kinds of salads, and gomen, which is collard greens. Though it might not be a traditional method of ordering, I decided to go for another dish known as doro wat, a famous Ethiopian food that's a chicken stew made from onions, berbere spices, and lots of butter. Also, the egg in the doro wat is one of the highlights. The doro wat was scooped directly onto the pile of injera, mingling with the other wonderful ingredients.

As you can already imagine, I was so incredibly excited to begin my feast at Kategna restaurant, my mouth juices were flowing. There were two different colors of injera that I got served, something I didn't really notice from other restaurants I ate at while I was in Addis Ababa. But after tasting both, they really almost tasted identical. I quickly grabbed pieces of injera, ripping it off the roll and digging it into the juicy curries. The flavor combination were out of control delicious. The vegetarian mix of yetsom beaynetu was excellent. Then it was time to devour the doro wat. The piece of chicken was oddly small, just a time bone with a little bit of meat, but the sauce and egg together were so delicious, that I honestly almost forgot about the chicken itself. The sauce was dripping with flavor!

Despite Kategna restaurant being on the nicer side of the restaurant spectrum, the prices are incredibly reasonable. For me entire feast in the video, including the coffee at the end, our total bill came to 230 ETB ($11.85), and believe it or not, I was actually stuffed full for almost the entire day afterwards, I hardly have to eat any dinner! There are two main locations of the restaurant in Addis Ababa, one just off Gabon street (the one featured in this video) and the other is just off Bole road very near to the airport. I went to both locations during my time in Addis, and they were both of equal greatness, and even the atmosphere was just about the same.

When you visit Addis Ababa, one of the best restaurants is Kategna restaurant, and you should not miss out on the opportunity to eat there!

1085,Thai green papaya salad recipe (som tam ส้มตำ) - Thai Recipes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9bGSSsfaCw,Food,"Click here http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/01/thai-green-papaya-salad-recipe/ for the full Thai green papaya salad recipe (som tam ส้มตำ) ingredients and cooking instructions.

Thai green papaya salad, known better as ""som tam"" (ส้มตำ) is one of the most popular Thai street food dishes available. Though it's an Isaan, northeastern Thai dish, som tam can be found throughout the entire country, and is widely popular in Bangkok where you'll find it being served at just about every street corner in the entire city.

So today, in this video, I'll be showing you how to make this Thai green papaya salad recipe. There's actually no cooking involved in this Thai recipe, and as long as you can get the ingredients fresh, you'll be able to make this salad and it will taste wonderful. Probably the hardest part of making som tam would be combining the exactly right combination of dressing ingredients together - it's a ratios and a balance thing - and it's also up to your own personal taste buds the way you like it. I personally enjoy my Thai green papaya salad spicy and sour. But many people like it less spicy and sour, and more sweet. Even when you order your Thai green papaya salad on the streets of Thailand, the vendor will occasionally reach in with the spoon and motion to give you a sample so you can taste if it's the way you like it, and if not, you can tell them to add more chili, more fish sauce, or anything else to make it the way you like it. So make sure you taste test!

Ok, so anywhere, this recipe makes just one big plate of som tam, which you can share with others along with other dishes for a full meal, or you can eat the whole thing yourself. Thai green papaya salad is a very common lunchtime dish in Bangkok, often eaten with a skewer of grilled chicken and a bag of sticky rice for starch.

Here are the ingredients:

2 cloves of garlic
5 Thai chillies
2 tablespoons roasted peanuts
1 tablespoon fish sauce
½ - 1 tablespoon palm sugar
1 - 2 limes
1 tablespoon of dried shrimp (optional)
1 - 2 small tomatoes (in Thailand I used sida tomatoes, but you could probably use roma tomatoes)
1 green papaya
Long-beans or green beans
Green cabbage
Thai sweet basil

1007,Thai Breakfast at Talad Wat Rai Khing (ตลาดวัดไร่ขิง),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dPyv-YbtE0,Food,"Talad Wat Raiking (ตลาดวัดไร่ขิง) is a Sunday morning market in Nakhon Pathom (นครปฐม), Thailand. More details here: http://migrationology.com/2014/08/breakfast-thai-fruit-carving-salads/

Mornings are one of the best times in Thailand to find delicious food. You'll find morning markets throughout Thailand every single day, and even more markets on the weekends as well.

One of the many famous markets on the morning weekends, located in the town of Nakhon Pathom, which is about an hour outside of central Bangkok, is Talad Wat Rai Khing (ตลาดวัดไร่ขิง), located across the river from Wat Rai Khing Temple.

It was my first time to ever go to Talad Wat Rai Khing (ตลาดวัดไร่ขิง), so I was excited to walk around, explore the market, and then sit down for a delicious Thai breakfast.

Among the many options that are available for Thai breakfast, is a dish called tom luad moo (ต้มเลือดหมู), which basically would translate to pork and pork blood soup, served with a bowl of rice on the side. The soup was not spicy or filled with too many flavors, it was mostly just a mixture of pork, cubes of boiled pork blood, some of the pig organs, all boiled into a meaty flavored soup, and seasoned with probably just a little bit of salt and pepper. But on my table, I also found some chili flakes, and some vinegar, which I added to my bowl of tom luad moo (ต้มเลือดหมู ), to increase the flavor.

Along with my bowl of tom luad moo (ต้มเลือดหมู), I also had a cup of black muddy coffee - not bad - but not the greatest cup of coffee I’ve ever had either.

If you ever happen to be in Nakhon Pathom (นครปฐม) on a Sunday morning, you can walk around Talad Wat Rai Khing (ตลาดวัดไร่ขิง), do some snacking, and have a hearty morning Thai breakfast.

3591,WHY POVERTY? Poor Us: an animated history,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxbmjDngois,History,"Do we know what poverty is?

The poor may always have been with us, but attitudes towards them have changed. Beginning in the Neolithic Age, Ben Lewis's film takes us through the changing world of poverty. You go to sleep, you dream, you become poor through the ages. And when you awake, what can you say about poverty now? There are still very poor people, to be sure, but the new poverty has more to do with inequality...

More about Bharawan Da Dhaba:
Located near the Golden Temple, Bharawan Da Dhaba is a great pure veg restaurant in Amritsar. It was set up over 100 years ago, in 1912. The food here tastes extremely delicious because every dish is slow-cooked on a low flame. When you're craving for authentic Punjabi food, order their famous Makki Ki Roti and Sarson Ka Saag. It is a great family restaurant with a loyal customer base. Talking about their ambience, it has a perfect dining atmosphere with old-fashioned tables, chairs, working fans and a huge crowd of regular visitors. You can also go for their stuffed kulchas (paneer, aloo) with Amritsari chhole.

Address: Near Town Hall, Outside Golden Temple, Amritsar, Punjab
Price for two: Rs.600

1227,Southern Thai Kaeng Som Soup (แกงส้มใต้) - Flames of Flavor!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJSzHGtsoQc,Food,"Visit: http://migrationology.com/ for more travel and food!

There's a ton of amazing Thai food, but in the end for me it all really comes down to southern Thai food. It's more like Malaysian food, flavorful dishes made from fish, scorchingly hot soups and curies and coconut milk it widely represented.

In the episode I enjoy one of my favorite flavors in the entire world, a Thai southern soup known as Kaeng Som (แกงส้มใต้). The base of the soup is made with garlic, lots of chillies and fresh turmeric root. Those ingredients are blended and added with water. Kaeng Som can be made with a variety of other ingredients but for this particular version, we made it with slices of barracuda fish and with sweet pineapple. It's also common to be cooked with bamboo shoots, green papaya or young coconut shoots.

The flavor is intense, a hot and sour soup that will literally probably burn your throat going down but that will flavor up your mouth like you've never imagined. If you ever get sick and need to clear your nostril, kaeng som is the ultimate treatment!

Note: In Bangkok when you order kaeng som (แกงส้ม), it's a red sweet and sour soup - but in the south, this is was kaeng som is, sometimes referred to as kaeng leung in Bangkok.

Southern Thai food is a complex cuisine of wonderful and often robust flavors. When you're dining in Thailand, it literally can not get much better!

7785,Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHtseplPqO4,Science&Technology,"Hugh LeCaine of Ottawa created the Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer in his home studio over a period of three years from 1945 to 1948. This synthesizer is the first voltage-controlled synthesizer ever built, preceding the manufacture of commercial synthesizers by twenty years. Le Caine, a nuclear physicist with the National Research Council, was passionate about music. He was concerned that the musical notes produced by electronic instruments in the 1930s, such as the Hammond Organ and the Morse Robb Wave Organs, lacked a certain expressivity. Determined to shape technology for the needs of the musician and expand the possibilities of musical sound he built a synthesizer that allows for complex variations in pitch and tone. This, LeCaine achieved, through the innovative use of voltage control. The technique provides an automatic background voltage that can remain stable or be altered through the manipulation of the knobs and keyboard. The keys are sensitive to a vertical pressure that controls the volume and a lateral pressure that changes the pitch. In this way the musician can simultaneously manipulate the volume, pitch, and timbre of each note and produce gradual transitions from one sound to the next. The rudimentary appearance of the synthesizer  its three legs made of crossed pieces of scrap wood and with instructions penciled onto its surface  camouflages the brilliant concept behind this invention. LeCaine's Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer is the precursor of today's electronic instruments."

-- transcript --

Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. I would love to share with you a story.
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book. Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling. It was venerable. It was ubiquitous. But it was a little bit boring. Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device. But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.
His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer. Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, and he said, ""Genug ist genug!"" He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors. This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold. History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book.
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. And this was a cause for celebration. The art of storytelling has remained unchanged. And for the most part, the stories are recycled. But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty.
And they remembered a man, one amazing German, every time a new storytelling device popped up next. And for that, the audience -- the lovely, beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after."

8830,Goodbye Silicon! Your Next Computer Chip Could Be Made of Gallium Oxide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSqkHBuXNU,Science&Technology,"A new material may be coming for 'Silicon Valley' as researchers are looking towards gallium oxide to produce faster computer chips than ever before.

Moore's Law Is Ending... So, What's Next? - https://youtu.be/Vv_2C95cO6s

The dawn of gallium oxide microelectronics
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180206115113.htm
“The material's flexibility for various applications is due to its broad range of possible conductivities -- from highly conductive to very insulating -- and high-breakdown-voltage capabilities due to its electric field strength.”

Chip upgrade helps miniature drones navigate
http://news.mit.edu/2018/novel-chip-upgrade-helps-miniature-drones-navigate-0620
“The new computer chip, named “Navion,” which they are presenting this week at the Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits, is just 20 square millimeters — about the size of a LEGO minifigure’s footprint — and consumes just 24 milliwatts of power, or about 1 one-thousandth the energy required to power a lightbulb.”

Moore’s Law
https://gigaom.com/2018/05/31/moores-law/
“Doubling the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles the power of the computer. If that were the entire story, it would be of minor interest. But along came Ray Kurzweil, who made an amazing observation: computers have been doubling in power from way before transistors were even invented.”

Rajiv Dixit was an Indian Orator. He started social movements in order to spread awareness on topics of Indian national interest through the Swadeshi Movement, Azadi Bachao Andolan and various other works. He served as the National Secretary of Bharat Swabhiman Andolan he was also founder of Bharat Swabhimaan Andolan. He was a strong believer and preacher of Bharatiyata. He had also worked for spreading awareness about Indian history, issues in the Indian constitution and Indian economic policies. He was also Indian scientist and very few people know that he has worked with APJ Abdul Kalam. Being a Scientist he could have enjoyed his life very well in USA or UK but he sacrificed his life to bring awareness among the People against Black money, Loot of Multinational Companies, Corruptions, Benefits of Indian made items and Ayurveda. He was struggling past 20 years against multinational companies and wants to protect Indian freedom.

राजीव दीक्षित एक भारतीय वक्ता थे। उन्होंने स्वदेशी आंदोलन, आजादी बचाओ आंदोलन और विभिन्न अन्य कार्यों के माध्यम से राष्ट्रीय हित के विषयों पर जागरूकता फैलाने के लिए सामाजिक आंदोलनों शुरू किये थे। वो भारत स्वाभिमान आन्दोलन के संस्थापक और राष्ट्रीय सचिव भी रह चुके हैं। राजीव दीक्षित भारतीयता के उपदेशक थे। उन्होंने भारतीय इतिहास, संविधान में मुद्दों और आर्थिक नीतियों के बारे में जागरूकता फैलाने के लिए काम किया था। राजीव दीक्षित एक भारतीय वैज्ञानिक थे और बहुत कम लोगों को पता है कि वह एपीजे अब्दुल कलाम के साथ भी काम कर चुके है। एक वैज्ञानिक होने के नाते अगर वह चाहते तो अमेरिका या ब्रिटेन में बहुत अच्छी तरह से अपने जीवन का आनंद ले सकते थे लेकिन उन्होने अपने जीवन का बलिदान काले धन, बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियों की लूट, भ्रष्टाचार, भारतीय वस्तुओं का लाभ और आयुर्वेद के लिए जागरूकता लाने के लिए दिया। उन्होने बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियों के खिलाफ संघर्ष और भारतीय स्वतंत्रता की रक्षा करने में अपनी ज़िन्दगी के 20 साल लगा दिए।"

7395,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbo_wbfRZm0,Science&Technology,"It’s an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new “things” and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ’90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you’re a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we’re being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we’re not exaggerating at all.

Rob is on a mission to solve this problem.  We can all easily be a part of the solution… and it starts with a dumpster.

TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoe

Rob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he’s dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

“To get data on what happens to spent nuclear fuel over long periods of time, researchers are turning to a unique place on Earth — the oldest, and only, known natural nuclear reactor.”

“For such a phenomenon to have happened naturally, these uranium deposits in western Equatorial Africa must have had to contain a critical mass of U-235 to start the reaction. Back in those days, they did. A second contributing factor was that, for a nuclear chain reaction to happen and be maintained, there needed to be a moderator. In this case: water.”

“In a singular but well-documented circumstance, scientists have found evidence that naturally occurring fission reactors were created inside three uranium ore deposits in the west African country of Gabon.”

1080,Authentic Thai larb recipe (larb moo ลาบหมู) - Thai Recipes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elcphgkyYLY,Food,"Experience authentic Thai flavors in this Thai larb recipe (larb moo ลาบหมู). Get the recipe details here: http://wp.me/p4a4F7-2ff

Thai larb, often made with minced pork (larb moo ลาบหมู), is one of the most popular Thai street food dishes. Though on the streets of Thailand it's most of the time made with pork, you can also find it made with minced chicken, or even minced duck. I also like versions of larb made with roasted catfish, known as larb pla duk. But anyway, for the Thai larb recipes I'll be using minced pork, but feel free to substitute whatever other meat you'd like. Even mushrooms or tofu works well. Thai larb is a meat salad dish. Along with the meat you choose, you mix in some fish sauce, lots of lime juice, chili flakes, shallots, and some herbs to freshen things up. In Thailand when you eat larb it's normally an Isaan dish, so it's often eaten together with green papaya salad (http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/01/thai-green-papaya-salad-recipe/) and eaten along with Thai sticky rice. I love the flavors in this dish, and especially love how the meat is so refreshing and flavorful.

As long as you have all the ingredients on hand, and as long as the ""khao kua"" or toasted sticky rice is prepared in advance, this Thai larb recipe is extremely easy to prepare and should only take a few minutes to make. You begin with cooking the minced pork, and from there you don't need to cook anything else, you just start to mix in all the dressing ingredients. Again, like with all Thai recipes and cooking, be sure to taste test plenty of times until you have your larb tasting exactly the way you want it to taste - I especially love spicy and sour.

Ok, here is your ingredients list for this authentic Thai larb recipe:
About 5 tablespoons of uncooked Thai sticky rice (this is going to be toasted and used as an ingredient in the dish)
300 grams (1 pound) minced pork
½ - 1 tablespoon of chili flakes (prik bon)
1/8 tablespoon of sugar (just a pinch)
½ tablespoon of fish sauce
1 - 2 limes (I used the juice from about 1.5 limes)
3 - 4 small shallots (Thai shallots are only about the size of grapes, so if you have bigger shallots just use however much you want)
A few leaves of culantro, which is a little like cilantro, if you can't find any, you don't need to use it
3 - 5 spring onions (green onions)
About 20 leaves or so of fresh mint

I am creating these Thai street food recipes as a resource for authentic Thai cooking - and by authentic I mean real everyday meals and food that you could eat when you're in Thailand. If you follow this recipe you'll be tasting the same food that you could get on the streets of Bangkok or Chiang Mai. Enjoy this recipe, and be sure to give this video a quick thumbs up, and let me know if you have any questions in the comments below.

“Inspired by the body’s approach for breaking down alcohol, we chose three natural enzymes that convert alcohol into harmless molecules that are then excreted. That might sound simple, because these enzymes were not new, but the tricky part was to figure out a safe, effective way to deliver them to the liver.”

Alcohol Metabolism: An Update
https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa72/aa72.htm
“Much of the research on alcohol metabolism has focused on an intermediate byproduct that occurs early in the breakdown process—acetaldehyde. Although acetaldehyde is short lived, usually existing in the body only for a brief time before it is further broken down into acetate, it has the potential to cause significant damage.”

A Hepatocyte‐Mimicking Antidote for Alcohol Intoxication
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201707443
“Inspired by the metabolism of alcohol, a hepatocyte‐mimicking antidote for alcohol intoxication through the codelivery of the nanocapsules of alcohol oxidase (AOx), catalase (CAT), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to the liver, where AOx and CAT catalyze the oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde, while ALDH catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate.”

102,Chinese Street Food HOT POT HEAVEN + RABBIT Noodles and SPICY Dumplings in China - CHILI OIL 4 LIFE!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUy8Xf3_AtA,Food,"Chinese Street Food in Chengdu, China is the BEST in the WORLD!
► BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioil4life

In this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're bringing you to eat at 4 classic Chengdu foods. Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods.

►For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ►https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ultimate-chengdu-food-tour/

In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first.

And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!

After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!

And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy! For detailed addresses to these restaurants and street foods, make sure to visit my full Chinese food guide to Chengdu, China:

8742,Why a Half Degree Rise in Global Temperature Would Be Catastrophic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teZk3NLU_7M,Science&Technology,"According to a new report, Earth is likely to reach 1.5°C warming by 2030. Here’s why that’s a big deal.

IPCC: Global Warming of 1.5 °C
http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/
“An IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.”

Why Half a Degree of Global Warming Is a Big Deal
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html
“The Earth has already warmed 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 19th century. Now, a major new United Nations report has looked at the consequences of jumping to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius.”

What genuine ambition on climate change would look like
https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/7/17306008/climate-change-global-warming-scenarios-ambition
“ It is generally agreed that hitting 2 degrees would be quite ambitious, while hitting 1.5 would be nothing short of miraculous. Yet the scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in their latest report, are pleading with the world to go for it, because at this point, every fraction of a degree of warming matters.”

We are traveling through southern China on a 6 week street food journey through Sichuan and Yunnan, all to eat and taste the best street food and discover unheard of street food and to chat with friendly local people. This is all part of the ancient tea horse road.

If you’re traveling to China as a tourist for street food and like to travel all around the world to eat street food, you must visit Yunnan to try local Yunnanese street food specialties. China really is an amazing place for street food, the local Chinese recipes will blow you away!

Chinese street food and Chinese cuisine is so diverse and amazing that you could travel through China for a whole lifetime and you wouldn’t be able to eat all of the delicious Chinese recipes. So you really just have to arrive here and taste as much street food as you can!

Chinese cuisine and Chinese street food is so abundant and diverse that you could travel through China for a lifetime and still not eat all of the delicious Chinese recipes. So the best thing you can do is just arrive with an open mind and a strong appetite and you won’t be let down!

The address of this location was in Dali old town in a narrow back alley, but only happens once per year. The rest of the time, it’s a courtyard and temple.

In this food and travel video/vlog, I take you on a full Chinese street food tour of Guangzhou (keep this food in mind if you also visit Hong Kong)- we eat a lot of specialties on the street and in Chinese restaurants together. The addresses for these locations are listed below. Chinese/Asian food recipes are going to be included in my blog shortly.

1) Local street food Chang Fen (rice noodle roll) - These are found throughout the city and are famously eaten during breakfast time in Guangdong, or during yumcha dimsum. I went to a very cheap Chinese restaurant specializing in Changfen in Baiyun district:
Name: 潮汕辉记肠粉
Address: 广州市白云区岗贝路4号

2) The best and must try chashaobao AKA charsui bao AKA BBQ pork bun. These beauties are like upgraded baozi steam buns you find all over the streets of China. The pork juicy and covered in a sweet Barbeque sauce and the bun is so fluffy, you won't be able to get enough of them!
Name: 天天包点
Address: 广州市越秀区起义路72号

3) Famous Chinese street food Chashao BBQ pork and Shao'e roast goose. These are the best and two must try street foods in China, especially during lunch hour in Guangzhou or Hong Kong
Name: 九爷鸡
Address: 广州市越秀区文明路103号

4) Dim sum at the famous yumcha dim sum restaurant Dim Dou Dak. This is a chain restaurant that serves some of the best cantonese dim sum in the city. Be sure to order the shao mai dumplings, har gao dumplings, fengzhua chicken feet, and their specialty red rice roll. So good!
Name: 点都德
Address: 广州市越秀区越秀中路60号宝贝城4楼

5) The largest wholesale seafood market in Guangzhou. There is a huge selection of seafood here, you could spend a whole day here just watching and discovering all the different types of fresh seafood. It's not cheap unfortunately, it's quite expensive! Be ready to bargain a little bit.
Name: 盛港湾酒楼
Address: 广州市海珠区黄沙海产批发市场

If you have a whole day in Guangzhou or even Hong Kong (you can find exactly the same street foods) to travel and eat and try Chinese street food, then visit some of these amazing and best street food locations! Please leave me a comment down below if you did and let me know how the food was!

8242,Redefining Learning & Teaching using Technology. | Jason Brown | TEDxNorwichED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOTEQVYDPpg,Science&Technology,"""Did you know that 16% of 8-11 year olds own five or more media devices and 72% of 12-15 year olds own three or more media devices? 51% of households with a child aged between 3 and 15 have a tablet compared to 7% in 2011. No matter where you look, children and students are using technology more and more because it is becoming more accessible. What is the education system doing to respond to this? Does technology have a place in schools? How can technology be used to effectively improve teaching, learning and productivity in the classroom?
""

Jason is a Year 13 A level student studying at Wymondham High Academy. He is passionate about technology in education and has been working with Microsoft to promote technology in education since November 2013. Part of his role as a Worldwide Microsoft Student Ambassador is to promote and advocate the use of technology such as smartphones and tablets in the classroom and inspire students to make the most of the technology they have. He has presented at events in Seattle and London about technology in education.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"

3895,Theologians Under Hitler (Religious Belief Documentary) | Timeline,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2MD15kt88A,History,"Check out our new website for more incredible history documentaries: HD and ad-free. http://bit.ly/2O6zUsK

In the days after World War II, a convenient story was told of church leaders and ordinary Christians that defied the Nazis from the beginning. Recent research has uncovered a very different story. Rather than resisting, the greater part of the German church saw Hitler's rise in 1933 as an act of God's blessing, a new chapter in the story of God among the German people.

This film, based on groundbreaking research, introduces the viewer to three of the greatest Christian scholars of the twentieth century: Paul Althaus, Emanuel Hirsch, and Gerhard Kittel, men who were also outspoken supporters of Hitler and the Nazi party. In 1933 Althaus spoke of Hitler's rise as ""a gift and miracle of God."" Hirsch saw 1933 as a ""sunrise of divine goodness."" And Kittel, the editor of the standard reference work on the Jewish background of the New Testament, began working for the Nazis to find a ""moral"" rationale for the destruction of European Jewry.

This provocative film asks: how could something like this happen in the heart of Christian Europe? Could it happen again? How does the scholarship of this period affect the church today? Does the church of today retain the ability to recognize profound evil?

Can you imagine our world in 2050? By mid-century there will likely be 9 billion people on the planet, consuming ever more resources and leading ever more technologically complex lives. What will our cities be like? How will we eat in the future of Earth? Will global warming trigger catastrophic changes, or will we be able to engineer our way out of the world climate crisis?

In the future world demographic changes will certainly be dramatic. Rockefeller University mathematical biologist Joel Cohen says it's likely that by 2050 the majority of the people in the world and USA will live in urban areas of the earth, and will have a significantly higher average age than people today.

1100,"Thukpa - Tibetan Noodle Soup at Boudha, Kathmandu, Nepal",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apktti19nbs,Food,"Thukpa is common Tibetan noodle soup that's found throughout Nepal, especially around the Boudhanath stupa area. More street food on my website: http://migrationology.com/

Boudhanath, or the Boudha Stupa, in Kathmandu, Nepal is home to many Tibetan people. It's a very interesting area that's perfect for exploring offers a good selection of local Nepali food and Tibetan food as well. Along with noodles and full meals, you'll also find a good selection of delicious Nepali street food (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf493MCi5rA). Like most of the Tibetan and Nepali restaurants in Kathmandu, they are hidden a little by curtains that hang in front of the restaurants blocking the windows. This makes it sometimes challenging to see what's going on inside, but luckily this thukpa small restaurant had their menu painted on the wall. Dal bhat is rice and dal soup, which is common throughout Kathmandu as well, but this little eatery specialized in only thukpa noodle soup.

I decided to go for the healthy version of vegetarian thukpa, instead of the buffalo or chicken version. The vegetarian was quite excellent, though I don't know just how vegetarian it was as that soup broth was incredibly flavorful! Who knows, but it was still excellent. After cooking it up in the back kitchen outdoors, the motherly lady delivered my bowl of thukpa to the table. It was piping hot. Like much of the Tibetan food (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENbqxmM3on0) I've eaten, this bowl of thukpa was a little on the plain side, but it was full of hearty flavor - just nothing too strong or spicy. But the great thing about Tibetan food is that there's always a bowl of extremely hot chili sauce at every table, just longing to be devoured. I can't resist it. So after sampling the thukpa for the first time I then reached for the chili sauce to give it some much needed spice and flavor. Overall, thukpa is a good and hearty dish that's cheap, easy to find, and tastes pretty good. When you're in Kathmandu, around the Boudha stupa, grab a bowl of freshly prepared thukpa noodle soup!

1385,Thai Street Food: The ULTIMATE Chinatown Bangkok Tour (เยาวราช) - Bangkok Day 9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6foYb9LLb3Y,Food,"Chinatown Bangkok (เยาวราช) is one of the best Thai street food areas of Bangkok. Download your free Bangkok food guide here: http://migrationology.com/2weeksinbangkok/

On Day 9 of this Bangkok travel guide video series (2 Weeks in Bangkok) we spent the entire day eating Thai food in Yaowarat (เยาวราช), which is Chinatown Bangkok. There are some seriously amazing dishes to eat!

1:20 Thai Haeng (ร้านไท้เฮง) Restaurant - To begin out Thai street food tour in Chinatown we started at a restaurant called Thai Haeng (ร้านไท้เฮง), and to specifically eat a dish called suki ruam mit haeng (สุกี้รวมมิตรแห้ง), which is Thai style suki, the dry version. It included napa cabbage, some other vegetables and a mix of seafood and meat, all stir fried with mung bean noodles. It had the most amazing smoky flavor, and was served with a Thai sauce made with fermented soy. We also had a plate of khao man gai (ข้าวมันไก่), which is Thai style chicken rice.

6:28 Sampeng Market (สำเพ็ง) - Along with Thai street food, one of the most famous things about Yaowarat (เยาวราช) is the shopping - both for food shopping and things shopping. Sampeng Market (สำเพ็ง) is a long market that occupies a walking road within Bangkok and you can find all sorts of random things within the market - especially buttons and textiles.

Eeia Saey (ร้านเอียะแซ) coffee shop and Kan Kee Namdaothong (ร้านคั้นกี่น้ำเต้าทอง) Chinese health drink - After finishing a little bit of shopping on this food tour, we stopped at two different places to get a drink. One of them is an old school Bangkok Chinatown heritage coffee shop, and then we had a bitter health beverage that was so intense it almost made me shiver. We then just quickly stopped off at Wat Leng Noi Yee (วัดเล่งเน่ยยี่), one of the most well known Chinese temples in Bangkok.

10:51 Khao Gaeng Jek Puey (ข้าวแกงเจ๊กปุ้ย) - I wasn’t actually planning on eating here on this day food tour in Bangkok, but after passing it, I couldn’t resist sitting down for a quick plate of Thai rice and curry at Khao Gaeng Jek Puey (ข้าวแกงเจ๊กปุ้ย). I got my usual order of stir fried crab, and I also decided to have the panang curry as well. This is one of the best Thai street food stalls in Bangkok especially for the incredibly atmosphere.  We continued walking through Talad Drok Itsara Nuphap (ตลาดตรอกอิสรานุภาพ) - a market in an alley.

15:07 Lek and Rut Seafood (ร้านเล็กกับรัตน์ซีฟู้ด) - When it comes to Thai food in Chinatown, seafood is one of the most popular choices. This time we ate at Lek and Rut Seafood (ร้านเล็กกับรัตน์ซีฟู้ด), which is right across the street from the other famous T and K seafood restaurant. We ordered some roasted prawns, and squid steamed in lime juice, garlic and chilies. The food was delicious!

21:56 Kuay Jab Nay Lek (ร้านก๋วยจั๊บนายเล็ก (อ้วน) - A Thai food trip to Chinatown wouldn’t be complete without a bowl of kuay jab tuk yang (ก๋วยจั๊บทุกอย่าง), which is a bowl of noodle rolls in a peppery broth. It’s one of the ultimate Thai dishes in Chinatown.

25:28 Hoy Kraeng Pa Jeen (หอยแครงป้าจิน) - To end the day of eating, at least for main street food stalls, we headed to Hoy Kraeng Pa Jeen (หอยแครงป้าจิน), a place that specializes in boiled blood cockles and mussels. They are some of the finest shellfish you’ll find anywhere in Bangkok, and this Thai street food stall has been around for over 50 years I believe. It’s an amazing place!

30:15 For dessert we had Khanom Pang Jao Gao (ขนมปังเจ้าเก่าเด็ดในเยาวราช), an incredibly popular place that specializes in grilled bread, and bua loy nam king (บัวลอยน้ำขิง), which is ginger soup and sesame dumplings.

1867,Why can't India manufacture cheaper products as compared to China? सस्ते और डुप्लीकेट प्रोडक्ट्स,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nrdOO64-eI,manufacturing,"Please Like, Share and Subscribe our channel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are 'Made in China' products cheaper than 'Made in India

So the question now is why does their product use so much? have you ever wondered ? Because he is cheap, so why is his product affordable? Why can not India make such a cheap product?

Labor is found in the lowest penny in China
China's Anual Average Productivity Growth
Most Raw Materials at Domestic Level
Competitive pricing
Expense on innovation or r & d
Duplicate product
Dumping Strategy
Product export in other countries
Break the market


So what should India do to come forward in this way?

1) Commericial rule, making bussiness easy
2) Improvement in manufacturing and agriculture sector
3) Multispecialist to Labor
4) Export has to be improved,
5) Stop buying their product

LYRICS:
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am"
7992,Rewind 2017 of Discovery's(SCIENCE) | Top 12 Biggest discoveries of 2017,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAGF8LQIbQ4,Science&Technology,"Please Like, Share and Subscribe our channel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared with the past year, we do some new discoveries from this weird poor world every year, because the world of science will not stop till the end of this world. So the 2017 year for science has been very good, because all the new innovations have been discovered,

1)
Firstly there is a shortage of fresh water for more than 1 billion people worldwide. Researchers from the University of California have created a solar powered device that draws water from the air at a humidity level. And while doing the test, that device pulled about three liters of water within 12-hours.

2)
The largest research done in July 2017, which is the Organ Bez Research. In which the DNA of the embryo in the human body can be changed. This is a gene-editing technique, through a CRISPR. This technique can be included in the major research of the human world.

3)
In which a new planet was researched in the science report. Whose name was given gliese 1132b. However, this Planet is 39 light years away from our planet. This is the first Planet that is bigger than the Earth and it also has Atmosphere. Due to being near Earth,

4)
After that, doctors in Philadelphia's Child Hospital have discovered a way to keep the fetal sheep alive from the mother's womb. The embryo calves were placed in the artificial womb, which was filled with complete amniotic fluid, because it had linked the umbilical cords to a machine due to which its blood could get oxygen.

5)
After that, 11 had already been discovered in the Dead Sea of ​​Jerusalem, the last cave named Crawl was discovered 60 years ago. But after so many years, in the year 2017, archaeologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem discovered the 12th cave near the north-west coast of the Dead Sea. Although nothing special from inside, a leather belt and some clothes. And it is considered the ancient cave of Judeo-Christian texts.

6)
After that another search was done in the sea. Below the Mauritius Island, the researchers discovered the fragment of an ancient continent and the lava of that continent is three billion years old. This is called ""Mauritia"". It was part of a super continent Gondwinnaland, present 200 million years ago.

7)
After that an undergraduate student invented fossilized teeth of small and rodent organisms while climbing rocks in Dorset, England. According to the researchers, they are the ancestors of the placental, ""animals which have given birth to them after feeding the fetus through the box,"" according to CBC they are the ancestors of mankind.

8)
After that, Alisha Gaurou, a student of the University of Victoria's PhD, discovered a 14,000-year-old village while digging on Trikot Island, about 500 kilometers from Victoria. The remains of this ancient village are three times as old as the pyramid of Giza. Including fish hooks, spears, coal flakes, and some old equipment to set fire.

9)
After that in August 2017, scientists discovered gravitational waves from binary neutron star merger. Electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves were omitted together, so scientists were able to determine that the difference between speed of light and the speed of gravity is the speed of 3 x and 7x light.

10)
After that, the estimated population of penguins in East Antarctica has twice the population over there. These surveys were published in March 2017. During the breeding season this survey was done on the ground and it was found that most penguins were not present on it. According to the new global estimate, there are 14 and 16 million birds, and in East Antarctica there are approximately 60 lakhs, which came to know in 2017.

11)
After that, a peptrocer's headpinzer was discovered in Mongolia, and their feathers were about 11 meters, that is 36 feet long, which was possibly considered one of the largest petrochemicals. In the time of the Petrosaur i.e. mesosoeq era i.e. dinosaurs used to be such birds. And the Hadpinner is some 70 million years ago.

12)
After this, the scientists exposed the largest volcanic field in the last summer, which is located two kilometers away from the West Antarctic ice sheet. This area comprises 91 volcanoes, one of which is at an altitude of 4,000 meters (13,000 feet). That is, due to an explosion, ice may possibly melted from below.

✳️ Discover The 8 FUNDAMENTAL Pillars Of Survival: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZFH3QfmYiM

This awesome National Geographic documentary series, Japan between sky and earth, takes us on a journey of discovery though a wild and little-known Japan filmed and showed as never before with spectacular aerial shots. These travel Nat Geo documentaries (also broadcast on the BBC and on the Discovery Channel) reveal the mystery of some the most beautiful sites in the country, the great spectacle of nature and the subtle balance that prevails in Japan between tradition and modernity.

Japan, Land of the Rising Sun, with its panoramas forged by volcanoes and tradition, is a mighty international economic power. In the far north of the country, Hokkaido, one of the four large islands making up the archipelago, the ancient and sacred land of the Ainu people, is a vast natural paradise. As you will see in this breathtaking documentary, this journey over the four seasons of the year, between earth and sky, volcanoes and clear lakes, tells the unique story of people who live at one with nature.

Sheep are able to recognize human faces from photographs
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-11/uoc-saa110317.php
“Sheep can be trained to recognise human faces from photographic portraits - and can even identify the picture of their handler without prior training - according to new research from scientists at the University of Cambridge.”

This Is How Dolphins ‘See’ Humans With Echolocation
https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-dolphins-see-humans-echolocation-180957481/
“A group of researchers recorded and analyzed the echolocation sounds used by a dolphin when it came face to face with a number of objects (including a human male), reconstructing a series of 2-D and 3-D images that show how dolphins ‘see’ objects underwater.”

The Unexpected Genius of Corvids
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyw99k/the-unexpected-genius-of-corvids
“Perhaps the best argument for this is crows' well-documented facial recognition ability. Back in 2008, researcher John Marzluff at the University of Washington began to notice that previously trapped members of the local crow population seemed more wary of certain members of his team, making them harder to capture.”

SIM CARD
Another options is to get a SIM card for your unlocked mobile device.  You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I’ll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.

(1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.

(2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn’t have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days, you can just buy a new card.

Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis. The earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser, which was built c. 2630–2610 BC during the Third Dynasty.

8277,Technology & the human mind | Susan Greenfield | TEDxOxford,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc7ZYj4CCdM,Science&Technology,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. What does the future have in store for us, as human beings? In this talk, Susan Greenfield explores how technology affects our personalities by affecting our neurochemistry. Drawing a parallel with climate change, she calls this challenge for humanity ""mind change"". But far from being a luddite, Greenfield sees a chance for humanity to benefit from embracing some of the changes these technologies will bring - just as long as we make sure to counteract the dangerous ones.

SUSAN GREENFIELD is a leading British neuroscientist, writer, broadcaster and member of the House of Lords. Whilst specializing in the physiology of the brain, her areas of research include the impact of 21st century technology on the mind, how the brain
generates consciousness as well as novel approaches to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons. In addition to being published in countless peer-reviewed journals, her work has led to numerous honours and awards including the Michael Faraday Medal from the Royal Society and thirty honorary degrees from universities across the world.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"

2510,Audi TT Production,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGRNhmtMAQw,manufacturing,"Györ, the Hungarian city on the Danube, is an ideal location for the manufacturing of high-tech engines and cars. Its merits lie not merely in the high availability of skilled workers and highly qualified university graduates.

AUDI HUNGARIA MOTOR Kft., a fully owned subsidiary of AUDI AG, builds over 1.9 million engines there each year, and assembles the Audi TT model range and the A3 Cabriolet, among other vehicles, in tandem with the Ingolstadt plant. Audi Hungaria is the principal engine supplier of the Audi and Volkswagen Groups, one of Hungary's highest revenue enterprises and also one of the country's biggest exporters.

ENGINE MANUFACTURING - Engine production (pre-series) started as long ago as the end of 1993. The engine production plant in Györ, Hungary, was inaugurated in October 1994. With this move, Audi not only safeguarded its international competitiveness, it also created a strategic base in Hungary that is gaining increasingly in importance. Györ now produces almost the entire range of Audi engines. Some 400 different versions of basic engines are built there: four, six, eight, ten and twelve-cylinder engines featuring both TDITDISynonymous with muscular torque delivery and outstanding efficiency: TDI. Today, TDI engines are sporty, smooth and economical.TDI and FSIFSIGetting more out of every drop of petrol.FSI technology. The ten millionth engine was completed there in June 2005. Volume production of the new four-cylinder common rail engines started in October 2007.

VEHICLE ASSEMBLY - Assembly of the Audi TT models at Györ commenced in April 1998. The first second-generation Audi TT Coupé left the Audi Hungaria production line in April 2006, and was followed by the first TT Roadster of the same generation in that November. The bodyshells, which have already been painted in Germany, are brought by train from Ingolstadt to Györ, where they are delivered to the assembly hall. By the end of 2007, 382,445 Audi TT Coupé and TT Roadster cars as well as 216 of the new Audi A3 Cabriolet had been assembled in partnership with the Ingolstadt plant. Audi has systematically realised a new, process-oriented production concept at the plant -- with short distances and fast, direct flows, from the delivery of parts to the transportation of the assembled cars."

Trip to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia travel diary / vlog (Day 1) Watch in 720p
Selamat Datang! (Welcome!)  Malaysia travel videos are upcoming from my 2018 trip in Kuala Lumpur.  This kl travel video sums up our first day trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 2018. Our trip in Kuala Lumpur City, Malaysia begins arriving at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang District Malaysia taking us about 4 hours from NAIA in  Manila via Malaysia Airlines. We stayed at Crown Regency Suites throughout our trip in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. Our Kuala Lumpur day tour kicks off at strolling around Suria KLCC and the famous Petronas Twin Towers. Of course, we could not possibly miss seeing the Petronas Towers in Malaysia especially we stayed only a few blocks away from this famous tourist attraction in Kuala Lumpur City. It was a dream to see the Twin towers in Malaysia with my very own eyes. As the sun sets, we ride Rapid KL train to Central Market Kuala Lumpur and from there we head to check out what Kuala Lumpur Chinatown has to offer us. This Chinese night market in Malaysia which was buzzing with busy people and a variety of products, was  where we ate our first dinner during our trip in Malaysia. This was only Day 1 but we truly experienced the joyful colors of Malaysia, can't wait to share more of our trip. Hope you enjoyed watching this Malaysia travel video diary, as much as I enjoyed filming and editing this cinematic travel montage. See you on Day 2 to 4!

Terima Kasih Berbnayak-banyak! Thank you very much!

Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. 

Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.

Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.

""A vacuum test campaign evaluating the impulsive thrust performance of a tapered radio-frequency test article excited in the transverse magnitude 212 mode at 1937 MHz has been completed. The test campaign consisted of a forward thrust phase and reverse thrust phase at less than 8×10?6torr8×10?6??torr vacuum with power scans at 40, 60, and 80 W.""

NASA's Physics-Defying EM Drive Passes Peer Review
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2016/11/19/nasas-physics-defying-em-drive-passes-peer-review/&refURL=&referrer=#316de78e76e2
""The reactionless thruster known as the EM Drive has stirred heated debate over the past few years. If successful it could provide a new and powerful method to take our spacecraft to the stars, but it has faced harsh criticism because the drive seems to violate the most fundamental laws of physics.""

NASA's Peer-Reviewed Paper on the EmDrive Is Now Online
http://motherboard.vice.com/read/nasas-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-emdrive-is-now-online
""Earlier this week we wrote about a leaked paper that apparently confirmed that NASA had built a working electromagnetic drive (or EmDrive), a theoretical (and ""impossible"") rocket propulsion system that seemingly violates Newton's Third Law of Motion. It's such a controversial subject that the the moderators of the /r/Physics subreddit deleted their thread with our post out of a conviction that the EmDrive is unscientific.""

338,Oliver! (The Musical) (1968) Food Glorious Food,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly7PONiKGUs,Food,"Oliver! (The Musical) (1968) This is just a small clip from the movie Oliver!
Food Glorious Food
Written by: LIONEL BART

Is it worth the waiting for,
If we live till eighty-four
All we ever get is gruel,
Every day we say our prayers
Will they change the bill of fair?
Still we get the same old gruel
There's not a crust not a crumb
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,
When we all close our eyes and imagine,

Food glorious food
Hot sausage and mustard
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next is the question?
Rich gentlemen have it boys
IN-DI-GESTION

Food glorious food
What is there more handsome
Gulped swallowed or chewed
Still worth a kings ransom
What is it we dream about?
What brings on a sigh?
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high

Food glorious food
Were anxious to try it
3 banquets a day
Our favourite diet
Just picture a great big steak fried, roasted or chewed
For food marvelous food wonderful food magical food fabulous food beautiful food
GLORIOUS FOOD"

Fuselage Automated Upright Build (FAUB) is a partnership of automation and manual work to assemble the forward and aft sections of the 777 fuselage. Teams load and set the panels, then the robots are moved in to help install thousands of fasteners to connect the sections. Mechanics are able to move the robots and massive parts around on automated guided vehicles (AGVs). That mobility and flexibility will allow FAUB to help manufacture all 777 models, including the upcoming 777X. Learn more:  bit.ly/777FAUB"

1210,Roti Canai and Teh Tarik - Malaysian Breakfast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNQSFCfjxuU,Food,"Go to http://migrationology.com/ for lots of travel and street food! Thanks for checking it out!

Malaysia is undoubtedly one of the top countries in the entire world when it comes to food, and no matter if you eat dinner, lunch, or breakfast, you'll find something extremely satisfying. Roti canai is one of the many Indian influenced Malaysian foods that is widely available and very popular to eat throughout the entire country. While it's served throughout the day, it's most commonly eaten as a breakfast item along with a milk tea known as teh tarik.

The flatbread all begins with ball of greasy dough that's slapped and expanded until it becomes paper thin. Then the vendor folds it up and throws it onto the hot griddle to cook, all while dousing it in oil and adding butter to the mix. This ensures that the roti canai comes out nice and golden brown on the outside and a little gooey and delicious on the inside. What I love most about the Malaysian style roti is that it's served along with a few sides of dipping curry sauce that make it extremely flavorful. While it's not the healthiest of all breakfast in Malaysia, it sure does taste amazing. Also at this street food stall I order something known as a roti telur, which is basically the same dough wrapped up with an fried egg in the middle. The result is a creation that's even better - a mouthwatering gooey and crispy bread that greasy and busting with flavor with a swift dip in the curry sauce. Nothing works better to wash down roti, than a fresh cup of brewed teh tarik, or just a milk teas. It's similar to chai and is just black tea made with thick milk so it's extremely milky and creamy. This particular version was made by a guy who tossed it from cup to cup to create a lovely creamy foam on the top. It was quite sweet, but contrasted so nicely with the roti that I couldn't resist a second cup.

So when you are in Malaysia and in need of breakfast, you do have plenty of options, and one of those being a tasty roti canai! I know you'll enjoy it!

4081,Is Religion Man-Made? How Did Religion Start? The Evolution of Belief (2006),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql2yz7XDs2A,History,"The evolutionary origin of religions theorizes about the emergence of religious behavior during the course of human evolution. About the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038338/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143038338&linkCode=as2&tag=ub066-20&linkId=878c5f216112d8f8ff88a9052ed4ffa5

Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived between four and six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while non-human primates are not religious, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of social norms, realization of ""self"" and a concept of continuity. There is inconclusive evidence that Homo neanderthalensis may have buried their dead which is evidence of the use of ritual. The use of burial rituals is evidence of religious activity, but there is no other evidence that religion existed in human culture before humans reached behavioral modernity.

Marc Bekoff, Professor Emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, argues that many species grieve death and loss.

There is general agreement among cognitive scientists that religion is an outgrowth of brain architecture that evolved early in human history. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to natural selection and has selective advantage, or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations. Stephen Jay Gould, for example, believed that religion was an exaptation or a spandrel, in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.

Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events (etiology), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions (theory of mind). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life, etc. The emergence of collective religious belief identified the agents as deities that standardized the explanation.

Some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically ""hardwired"" into the human condition. One controversial hypothesis, the God gene hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the VMAT2 gene, predispose to spirituality.

Another view is based on the concept of the triune brain: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by Paul D. MacLean. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through sociobiological conditioning and social sanction. Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex. Reason is pre-empted by emotional drives. The religious feeling in a congregation is emotionally different from individual spirituality even though the congregation is composed of individuals. Belonging to a collective religion is culturally more important than individual spirituality though the two often go hand in hand. This is one of the reasons why religious debates are likely to be inconclusive.

Yet another view is that the behaviour of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in religion. Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress. This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of hierarchies of warriors, which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote fertility and kinship.

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying.

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out.

The “Cidade Maravilhosa,” or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

There is no doubt that developing hardware is hard, and you can’t expect immediate results.  But if you break it down into manageable steps it is possible to succeed with building the hardware.

Most hardware product prototyping can be split into two sections:

The electronics, and
The plastic and/or metal case.
During design review and electronic product development, there are various critical considerations that need to be addressed.

isubTECH specializes in helping entrepreneurs and inventors take their ideas and inventions, turn them into a working prototypes and prepare them for final product design and manufacturing.

1136,Rajasthani Food - Dal Baati Thali in Jaipur,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKvVTACWr1w,Food,"More Rajasthani food and Indian street food on my website: http://migrationology.com/

Like everywhere else I travel, my priority is discovering and sampling the local cuisine, and in Rajasthan, a popular everyday meal is a Rajasthani thali that includes dal and baati. From Delhi, we took a quick train ride to Jaipur, the capital and largest city in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The city is also known as the Pink City and there are quite a few things to do and see around the area. I was most interested in the cuisine!

So my first Rajasthani food meal was at Santosh Bhojnalaya, located very near the bus station in Jaipur. It's a local style Indian restaurant, serving up hungry travelers that need a quick and delicious feast. This local restaurant had little on the menu but a selection of thalis, the Rajasthani version being the most popular.

I order the dal baati. I didn't know exactly what I was going to get at first, but unlike south India where rice is dominant, rice isn't all that popular in Rajasthan. The meal I go included just a small side of rice, not the main dish of the meal. Anyways, dal is the lentil soup that ubiquitous in nearly all Indian thali meals. Baati are small wheat balls that in this case were deep fried, about the size of golf balls, and very crispy on the outside. They were crumbly on the inside, thick, and heavy, very hearty too. As soon as I was served my Rajasthani food, the server broke up one of my baatis to show me how to eat it. He then instructed me to mix my broken baati with the dal and mingle it together before taking a bite. The baati was a little on the dry side, but I did really like it. The thali also included a few other different types of dal and a few other vegetarian sides dishes. Along with dal baati, I also had a few chapatis which were served hot and fresh and very oily. My set meal also included a dessert which was like a crumbly nutty pastry.

Rajasthan is a dessert dry state in India, so the food reflects the climate and conditions. It's a place where food needs to be preserved, especially when embarking on long camel treks through the desert. Dal baati preserves well and travels well, so that's how it developed the way it did. I highly enjoyed my very first Rjasthani food meal in Jaipur, India!

La razón: una mina de diamantes. Sin embargo, hace ya mucho tiempo que colonos y buscadores de piedras preciosas se marcharon del lugar, y lo que antes era una ciudad floreciente, ahora no es más que una ciudad fantasma."

6206,14 HORAS en EL AVIÓN MÁS GRANDE DEL MUNDO! A380 😱| Alex Tienda ✈️,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9xX1NS15ek,travel blog,"Muchos me pidieron que viajara en el avión de pasajeros más grande del mundo, el Airbus A380.
Yo tenía muchas ganas de conocerlo por dentro desde hacía muchos años... Y esta ocasión por primera vez tuve la oportunidad de viajar en uno de ellos para viajar de Kuala Lumpur a México con escala en Londres, una ruta algo larga teniendo en cuenta que era más corto viajar por el pacífico en lugar de dar casi toda la vuelta al planeta... Pero así resultó ser la opción más barata y con la mejor opción de conexiones de vuelo que teníamos disponible para esa fecha. Espero les guste el video!

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"

1195,Thai Roasted JUMBO Shrimp (กุ้งเผา),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF4p5Y8SX7k,Food,"Check out my Eating Thai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/ and also my travel and street food website here http://migrationology.com/

One of my favorite things to eat in the world is shrimp and luckily Thailand is one of the top countries in the world in terms of producing shrimp. One day I decided to purchase a kilo of the Thai jumbo shrimp and bring them back home to roast them (กุ้งเผา).

Part of the reason why shrimp in Thailand have such large heads is because many local Thais consider the head to be the prized part of the creature. After all of them were finished being grilled, I decided to see for myself what the jumbo shrimp head juices were all about. The first step when eating goong pao (กุ้งเผา) is to first peel off the outer shell of the head. If you do this correctly, it will leave all the juices, meat, and brains from the head in tact. Then you just sort of suck it all down, half chewing while half biting. The brains of Thai shrimp are extremely butter and taste creamy, sweet, and a bit shrimpy.

After devouring the head of the shrimp it's then time to proceed to the body, which first needs to be shelled. The actual meat of it wasn't too big but still it was meaty and beautiful looking. I first dunked the shrimp into the spicy Thai seafood sauce before taking a bite. I can say way certainty that it was one of the best single bites of shrimp that I've ever tasted. Not only was it meaty, it was succulently rich, perfectly cooked, and packed with flavor. I'm a big fan of jumbo shrimp in Thailand and one of the best ways is to just enjoy them is to simply roast them (กุ้งเผา) over coals and serve them with chili sauce!

500 Years of Volcano Deaths Could Help Save the 800M People at Risk Today

""Sarah Brown, a professor of earth sciences at Bristol, and her team analyzed 500 years of data on volcanic fatalities. From 1500 to 2017, they found, more than 278,000 people have died from volcano-related hazards, amounting to 540 deaths per year on average. The researchers collected information on the distance each person was from the volcano when they died, using scientific reports, media coverage, and volcano activity bulletins.""

Ocean Volcanoes May Hold Clues to Alien Life

""The vents are home to a curious range of species collectively dubbed 'extremophiles,' which are organisms that can thrive in extreme environments, where most life wouldn't have a chance. They survive thanks to the unique chemical processes called chemosynthesis, wherein bacteria absorb toxic chemicals streaming from the vents and turn it into a food source. This symbiotic process proved that life could exist in extreme conditions without sunlight or oxygen.""

1132,Tibetan Street Food - Spicy Laping Noodles!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwkwx8V5qWI,Food,"Laping is a spicy cold noodle dish served as a Tibetan street food. For more food and travel check out my website: http://migrationology.com/

While exploring the Boudhanath stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal, I noticed a number of stall where a few people were gathered around sitting on low stools slurping down little plastic bowls of what looked like spicy tofu on noodles. So as a curious and adventurous eater traveler, the next thing I knew, I was sitting on a bench enjoying my very first bowl of laping, a Tibetan street food noodle dish.

As I explained in the video, it sort of looked like a yellow noodle pancake at the beginning. But as soon as you order a bowl of laping cold Tibetan noodles, the noodle is sliced up into strips and then combined with a number of different sauces, including soy sauce and vinegar. The vendor then asked us if we wanted it spicy, and our reply was by all means yes, so he added a spoon of lethal chili sauce into our bowls of laping noodles. Finally, a spoon of ground tofu was added to the top of the noodles to complete this unique snack. The bowls and dining ware kind of looked like a play set, but it worked well, despite the noodles being extremely slippery.

So my first bowl of laping was extremely delicious. The noodles are very smooth and soft and the sauce was salty, sour, and extremely spicy. The vendor wasn't joking when he mentioned to me at the beginning that the chili sauce was hot - it was hot and delicious. It was the type of chili sauce that made your lips burn.

After eating my bowl of laping Tibetan street food noodles, and having a chat with a little girl that was possibly the daughter of the vendor, we continued walking around, eventually sampling some Nepali street food (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf493MCi5rA). When you're in the Boudhanath stupa area of Kathmandu, Nepal, be sure to eat some laping noodles for a quick and refreshing snack!

Piano track written for a friend who was fighting cancer at the time . (She won!)

From the blog - April '07:

""There is a brand new music session available on music2work2. com. Emma was composed just last week. I find it a little different from some of the other sessions; it is a very interesting piece. It is solely piano and contains a mixture of mood and tempo. The image or thought that comes to mind when I listen to Emma is of ""life."" A single note, that is prominent at times throughout the session, reminds me of a clock or time ticking along. Like life, there are parts of the session that are somber and dramatic; there are parts that are light and cheerful - even ""jazzy."" The sound of the piano is sometimes simple, and sometimes complicated. It reminds me of the changes, the ups and downs, the joys and sorrows of life.""

http://music2work2.com/blog/new-session-on-music-2-work-2com


Emma is a remarkable women; her battle with cancer was picked up by BBC Radio Solent and run as part of their 100 Lives project. This article tells Emma's story better than I can -- check it out.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2008/04/04/solent_charlie_emma_pontin_feature.shtml

She is another of my favorite people and her brother's not bad either!



This track seems to really work for people writing papers.

Family gatherings are a great time to eat delicious food, and I was lucky enough to be able to taste home cooked Szechuan food at  a friend's birthday party in Chengdu.
Please like  https://www.facebook.com/foodrangin

If you're in Szechuan province, whether Chengdu or Chongqing, or any small town, there is a lot of food you have to try. There are so many dishes, but one of my favourite dishes that I love eating is the Szechuan spicy boiled fish (水煮鱼). It is just so delicious and spicy and numbing that it's so hard to resist!

Out of all the dishes (Szechuan spicy boiled fish, chicken feet, sweet and sour cabbage, devils taro spicy duck, Bangbangji, and Beijing duck) the Szechuan spicy boiled fish was the best! This episode was a lot of fun to make because it was different from the usual eating food on the street type video that I make (not that I don't love eating on the street!)

Thank you again for watching and please make sure to subscribe, it's the best way to keep my videos in your feed, and give me a thumbs up too if you liked this food video, thanks, I appreciate it!

Your support is greatly appreciated.

We are now at the Sermon on the Mount.  Yahshua is giving a lot of lessons.  This Part of the Sermon will be all of Matthew Chapter 5. These are the Points that you will take away from this part of the Series

1) Matthew 5:3-11 is good to ready daily for encouragement and understanding our reward.
2) We are the salt of the earth and should not mix our faith with the world so that we lose our flavor.  We need to let our light shine before all
3) Yahshua did not come to destroy the Torah, but to complete it which He did. We are now justified freely by Elohim’s grace through the redemption that is in Yahshua Ha Maschiach
4) Unless our righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, we will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.  This is why we need to be led by His Holy Spirit
5) Yahshua shows we are all guilty as if we committed murder if we’ve been angry through our words, thoughts, attitude, or actions unjustly
6) Do not assassinate a person’s character
7) We must protect our eyes from committing adultery.
8) You should not be divorcing for any other reason except sexual immorality
9) Do Not Swear at all. Let your “YES” be “YES” and your “NO” be “NO”
10) It is no longer an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.  Minister to others by walking out your faith in love
11)   Love your enemies and those who persecute you

1041,Irresistible Khao Soi (ข้าวซอย) in Chiang Mai,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wvU1olA5PU,Food,"Khao soi (ข้าวซอย) is one of the most popular Thai dishes to eat in northern Thailand, especially in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai. More details about Khao Soi Khun Yai (ข้าวซอยคุณยาย) here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/05/khao-soi-khun-yai-chiang-mai/

Khao soi (ข้าวซอย) is a Thai noodle dish that has origins in Burma. The basic part of the dish begins with a bowl of yellow egg noodles that are blanched and then combined with the all important curry gravy sauce which is made from coconut milk with a blend of dry spices. It's often nutty in flavor, slightly sweet, and flavorful from the dry spices. There are many different version of khao soi (ข้าวซอย), and some tend to be more spicy and flavorful, while other are more sweet and nutty - I prefer the former. So when I was searching for the best khao soi (ข้าวซอย) in Chiang Mai, I came across Khao Soi Khun Yai (ข้าวซอยคุณยาย) in a Travelfish article (http://www.travelfish.org/eatandmeet_profile/thailand/northern_thailand/chiang_mai/chiang_mai/1904) and decided to give it a try. Khao Soi Khun Yai (ข้าวซอยคุณยาย) in Thai means Grandmother's khao soi, and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience dining on food from grandmother, so I was pretty excited to give it a try.

As soon as I walked into the open air restaurant, I knew it was going to be my style. The restaurant was sort of street food style, but housed on the peaceful compound of the temple, away from the road, so it a nice and relaxing shaded place - a perfect environment for a perfect bowl of noodles. At Khao Soi Khun Yai (ข้าวซอยคุณยาย) they serve both khao soi (ข้าวซอย) and also kuay teow tom yam (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำเส้นเล็ก), the popular version of Thai noodles in a sweet and sour tom yum broth. My wife actually order the tom yum noodles, and they were also wonderful, but I was more interested in tasting their khao soi.

They normally have two different version, chicken and beef. So rather than having to make a hard decision, I decided to go for both - which I would highly recommend you do too - no need to make a decision. As soon as my bowls of khao soi (ข้าวซอย) were ready, they were delivered to our table, and I immediately loved the color of the broth, which was nice and dark red in color. Some bowl of khao soi, the broth is light and doesn't look all that flavorful. This was dark and red and you could just see all the spices and glorious flavors within it. I first tasted the broth, and then I went ahead and dumped in the rest of the condiments, mostly the roasted chili flakes to add some extra heat to it. The khao soi (ข้าวซอย) was incredibly good. The broth, or curry sauce was creamy and tasty, yet it wasn't too rich or sweet like it can sometimes be. It had a nice flavor blend of spices, and it was just balanced out perfection. The extra hit of roasted chili flakes added another wonderful dimension of flavor to my bowl of khao soi noodles. Along with any bowl of khao soi, you'll also be served some pickled mustard greens and slices of red onions on the side.

I havne't come close to trying every bowl of khao soi (ข้าวซอย) available in Chiang Mai, but out of the bowls of the dish that I've tried so far, I can say quite confidently Khao Soi Khun Yai (ข้าวซอยคุณยาย), serves the best khao soi I've ever had in Chiang Mai. If you love this Thai dish and are looking for an authentic, spiced to perfection version, you must include this wonderful restaurant on your itinerary.

1238,Thai Green Curry Chicken Recipe (แกงเขียวหวาน),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7xo-GJb10M,Food,"Click here for more Thai food: http://eatingthaifood.com/

Thailand is a country that is famous for its vibrantly flavorful cuisine and there are so many dishes that it can be challenging to actually figure out which dish to cook. One genre of Thai cuisine is the famous curries that range from green and red to yellow and brown - there are all sorts of curries in Thailand.

Most Thai curries are made with a meat base and flavored with curry paste blend that's made of a variety of spices and herbs.

While the curry paste is most amazing if you actually crush the ingredients together yourself, if you're in Thailand you can buy fresh paste that's already whipped up and ready to go (this saves quite a bit of time). On the other hand if you're out of Thailand you can also use canned or packaged curry paste that's not as good as the fresh stuff, but it will still be delicious.

Also, coconut milk is important for many Thai curries as the soup base. In Thailand it's easy to get freshly squeezed coconut milk, but cans of coconut milk will also work fine for this Thai recipe.

Thai green curry chicken (แกงเขียวหวาน) is a dish that never fails to impress - so here is a home cooked easy to make recipe that you'll surely get all kinds of compliments on!

First of all, here are the ingredients you'll need for this Thai green curry recipe video:

1. About one quarter of a chicken chopped up, but if you'd like, I think about two chicken breasts would also work fine.
2. Around twelve Thai round eggplants
3. Five non-hot spur chillies
4. Three to four stems of Thai sweet basil
5. Six to eight kaffir lime leaves
6. Around six cups of coconut milk, I'll be using fresh but you easily buy it in a can.
7. Four heaping tablespoons of thai green curry paste, since I'm in Thailand I'll be using fresh curry paste, but you can easily find it in a package.
8. You'll also need about a half a tablespoon of fermented shrimp paste also available in a can
9. Two teaspoons of sugar
10. and one teaspoon of salt

To make this Thai green curry chicken recipe, you'll need only about thirty minutes of time and the amount should serve around three to four people depending on how hungry you are and how many other dishes you may be serving for the meal as well.

Remember that Thai food recipes are never exact, meaning that it's a must to keep on testing the dish for yourself to make sure all the ingredients are correct. Thai green curry should be mild yet flavorful, creamy yet not so much where it's too rich to eat. Make sure you balance the flavors and add more or less of any of the ingredients in the tutorial.

Thank you very much for watching this video and hope you enjoy it!
